From its inception in **1980**, Chimera Lighting has gained a reputation for **innovation and excellence** in the photography and film industries for its exceptional lighting products. But, like many innovative companies, Chimera evolved from humble beginnings.

In 1980, advertising and album cover photographer **Gary Regester** and noted climber, photographer and engineer/designer **Tom Frost** joined forces to create Chimera's the first of a long line of **light modifiers**. Regester, who often photographed musicians on location, was looking for an alternative solution to creating the beautiful light he wanted for his portraits—one that created **broader and softer illumination** than umbrellas and a set-up that was **more practical and portable** than bulky lightboxes.

Regester, inspired by the design of **high altitude tents**, sketched out some rough ideas for a collapsible modifier, which generated overwhelming interest from his photographer friends. Set against the backdrop of **Boulder, Colorado**, Regester and Frost created the **Illuminata Lightbank** and Chimera was born.

The business initially started in the **Frosts' garage**, with Tom Frost cutting the fabric for the lightbanks and then outsourcing the sewing locally. In the early days, the lightbanks were mainly sold at tradeshows but the business grew and the Frosts purchased a building that remains in the Frost family and continues to be **home base for Chimera**.

Perhaps the tipping point was reached in **1990**, when gaffer **Mo Flam** and DP **Geoffrey Simpson** used Chimera equipment when filming the breakout movie, **"Fried Green Tomatoes."** Since then, Chimera has played—and continues to maintain—a **dominant role in the movie industry**. That's no surprise given the products' **rugged build**, ability to withstand the **high heat output from cinema lights** and to create the perfect illumination.`
